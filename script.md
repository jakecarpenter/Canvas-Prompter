I welcome these hearings because of the opportunity that they provide to the American people to better understand why the tragedy of 9/11 happened and what we must do to prevent a reoccurrence.
I also welcome the hearings because it is finally a forum where I can apologize to the loved ones of the victims of 9/11.
To them who are here in the room, to those who are watching on television, your government failed you.
Those entrusted with protecting you failed you.
And I failed you.
Good evening.

I'm Will McAvoy.
This is News Night, and that was a clip of Richard Clarke, former counterterrorism chief to President George W.
Bush, testifying before Congress on March 24, 2004.
Americans liked that moment.
[ cam 1 ]
I liked that moment.
Adults should hold themselves accountable for failure.
And so tonight I'm beginning this newscast by joining Mr.
<<Clarke in apologizing to the American people for our failure.>>
The failure of this program during the time I've been in charge of it to successfully inform and educate the American electorate.
Let me be clear that I don't apologize on behalf of all broadcast journalists, nor do all broadcast journalists owe an apology.
I speak for myself.
I was an accomplice to a slow and repeated and unacknowledged and unamended train wreck of failures that have brought us to now.
I'm a leader in an industry that miscalled election results, hyped up terror scares, ginned up controversy, and failed to report on tectonic shifts in our country.
From the collapse of the financial system to the truths about how strong we are to the dangers we actually face.
