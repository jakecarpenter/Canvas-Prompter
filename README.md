Canvas Prompter is intended to be a simple teleprompter, it should work in the browser on mac, pc, and iOS/android

Features I'd like to add:
*Remote Control
*Text from URL or file

How the program will work: (ie: todo)
*break the script into an abject, each word has an entry. 
      { ....
        221: {
                word: "hello",
                class: "base",
                width: 75
              },
        222: {
                word: "world",
                class: "base",
                width: 77
              },
        223: {
                word: "!",
                class: "base",
                width: 6
              }
        .....}
