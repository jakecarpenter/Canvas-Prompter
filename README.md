Canvas Prompter is intended to be a simple teleprompter, it should work in the browser on mac, pc, and iOS/android

Features I'd like to add: *Remote Control *Text from URL or file

<<<<<<< HEAD
How the program will work: (ie: todo) *break the script into an abject, each word has an entry. 
{ .... 
	221: { word: "hello", class: "base", width: 75 }, 
	222: { word: "world", class: "base", width: 77 }, 
	223: { word: "!", class: "base", width: 6 } .....}
